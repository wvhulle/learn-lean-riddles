# Learn Lean by solving riddles

(... riddles or computational problems)

This repository contains material for a [workshop on Lean](https://sysghent.be/events/lean/) given on 17th of July 2025 in Ghent for the [SysGhent](https://sysghent.be) community.

Using automated LLM agents with Lean will not be covered in this workshop (although they were used to quickly generate examples). See the [sysghent.be](https://sysghent.be/events) for future events.

## Target audience

This workshop is suitable for everyone who:

- is not afraid of mathematics or theorem proving,
- knows at least one functional programming language,
- loves mathematical or logical computational problems.

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).


## Learning material

A course is in preparation. Ask me for more information.
