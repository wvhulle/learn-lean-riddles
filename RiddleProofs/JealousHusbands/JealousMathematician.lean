# River crossing puzzle:

Three jealous mathematicians and their three secret notebooks must cross a river.
- The boat carries at most two items (people or notebooks).
- No mathematician may be left alone with another’s notebook unless the owner is present.

## Problem

Can they all get across safely?

## Decidability

Whether a property is decidable depends on how it is defined. If it is built from decidable operations and quantifies only over finite/enumerable types, Lean can often infer it (with infer_instance), but it cannot always do so automatically without being told to try.

## Obtaining solution

In each step we will transfer a mathematician or a notebook across the river.

This problem is similar to the "jealous husbands" riddle. The solution is identical.

## Structural recursion

A kind of recursion that is easy to check for termination. Termination can be checked by Lean automatically because the argument visibly and syntactically "erodes" (or shrinks) in the recursive call.

In the following, the size of the argument changes `n + 1` -> `n` in the recursive call at the end of the recursive function body.

def intermediate_states_structural_rec : (n: Nat) -> n < n_states → RiverCrossingState
  | 0, _ => initial_state
  | n + 1, h =>
    let prev := intermediate_states_structural_rec n (Nat.lt_of_succ_lt h)
    (transfers.get ⟨n, Nat.lt_of_succ_lt h⟩) prev

def intermediate_states_structural : Fin n_states → RiverCrossingState := (fun n =>  intermediate_states_structural_rec n.val n.isLt)

end StructuralRecursion

## Well-founded recusion

Some types of recursion may lead to infinite loops. Well-founded recursion is a recursive closure with a proof that the recursive closure terminates.

The result of `measure` allows argument j := <n+1,_> to fix to be compared against the recursive argument i:= <n,_> by mapping these arguments to the natural numbers.

  WellFounded.fix (measure (fun (i : Fin n_states) => i.val)).wf
    (fun i rec => match i with
      | ⟨0, _⟩ => initial_state
      | ⟨n + 1, h⟩ =>
        let prev := rec ⟨n, Nat.lt_of_succ_lt h⟩ (Nat.lt_succ_self n)
        (transfers.get ⟨n, Nat.lt_of_succ_lt h⟩) prev
    )
-- `noncomputable` exempts a definition from certain types of checks


-- Verify the start and end point are as expected.
example : intermediate_states ⟨0, by decide⟩ = initial_state := by
  decide

example : intermediate_states ⟨n_states - 1, by decide⟩ = final_state := by
  decide

-- We implemented decidability for `no_notebook_left_behind`, so we can use `decide`
