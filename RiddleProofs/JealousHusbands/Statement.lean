# Jealous husbands river crossing puzzle:

Three husbands (m1, m2, m3) and their respective wives (w1, w2, w3) must cross a river.
- The boat carries at most two people at a time.
- A man and a woman cannot be in the boat together unless they are married.
- A woman cannot remain on the same side of the river with a man unless her husband is present.
- The boat must always return to the other side to pick up the remaining passengers.

Left Bank                 ~~~      Right Bank
---------------------------------------------
H1 W1 H2 W2 H3 W3 |<~>|

The goal is to ensure all six individuals and the boat reach the right bank.
