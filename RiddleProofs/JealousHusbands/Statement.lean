# Problem statement: The jealous husbands puzzle

```
Left Bank                    River                    Right Bank
-----------------------------------------------------------------
H₁ W₁ H₂ W₂ H₃ W₃    [=======🚤======]               (empty)
```

Three husbands (H₁, H₂, H₃) and their wives (W₁, W₂, W₃) must cross a river using a small boat.

## The rules (constraints)

1. **Boat capacity**: The boat can carry at most 2 people at a time
2. **Boat operation**: The boat cannot cross the river by itself (someone must operate it)
3. **Jealousy constraint**: A wife cannot be alone with another husband unless her own husband is present

The **jealousy constraint** is the key challenge. For example:
- ❌ W₁ and H₂ cannot be together without H₁ present
- ✅ W₁, H₁, and H₂ can be together (H₁ protects his wife)
- ✅ H₁ and H₂ can be alone together (no wives involved)

## Mathematical modeling

We represent this as a **state space search problem**:
- **State**: Position of each person (left/right bank) + boat location
- **Actions**: Valid moves respecting all constraints
- **Goal**: All people and boat on the right bank
- **Safety predicate**: No jealousy violations at any intermediate state

This encoding demonstrates how **social constraints** become **logical predicates**
that can be automatically verified by the computer.

    **The jealousy rule**: A wife cannot be on the same bank with another husband
    unless her own husband is also present on that bank.
    
    **Logic breakdown**:
    - For each wife i and each different husband j (where i ≠ j)
    - For each bank (left or right)
    - Check: NOT (wife_i is on bank AND husband_j is on bank AND husband_i is NOT on bank)
    
    **Example violations**:
    - W₀ and H₁ alone on left bank (H₀ is on right bank) → unsafe
    - W₀, H₀, and H₁ all on left bank → safe (H₀ protects W₀)
    - H₀ and H₁ alone on left bank → safe (no wives involved) -/
