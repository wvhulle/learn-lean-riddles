## Group structure on button selections

### What is a group?

A **group** is a mathematical structure that captures the idea of symmetry and reversible operations.
Think of it like a set of actions where:
1. You can combine any two actions to get another action
2. There's a "do nothing" action (the identity)
3. Every action can be undone (has an inverse)
4. The order of grouping doesn't matter when combining multiple actions

### The Lights Out group

In Lights Out, button presses form a special kind of group called an **abelian group**
(named after mathematician Niels Abel). This means the order of button presses doesn't matter:
pressing button A then B gives the same result as pressing B then A.

**The group structure**:
- **Elements**: Each "button selection" is a choice of which buttons to press
- **Operation**: Combine two selections by pressing all buttons from both selections
- **Identity**: The empty selection (don't press any buttons)
- **Inverse**: In our puzzle, every button press is its own inverse! This happens because
  we're working in ℤ/2ℤ (integers modulo 2), where 1 + 1 = 0. Pressing a button twice
  returns to the original state.
- **Commutativity**: press(A) + press(B) = press(B) + press(A)

**Why this matters**: This group structure transforms a seemingly complex puzzle into
a linear algebra problem that can be solved efficiently. Instead of trying all 2^(m×n)
possible button combinations, we can use the group structure to find solutions systematically.

The mathematical notation (ℤ/2ℤ)^(m×n) means: a group where each of the m×n positions
can be either 0 (don't press) or 1 (press), with addition modulo 2.
