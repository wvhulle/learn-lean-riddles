## Vector space structure on button selections


The crucial observation is that button selections don't just form a group - they form a
**vector space** over the field 𝔽₂ = ℤ/2ℤ. This vector space structure is what makes
the Lights Out puzzle solvable via linear algebra.

**Vector space structure**:
- **Scalars**: 𝔽₂ = {0, 1} with addition and multiplication mod 2
- **Vectors**: ButtonSelection m n = (Button m n → 𝔽₂)
- **Addition**: Pointwise addition of selections
- **Scalar multiplication**: 0 · sel = ∅, 1 · sel = sel

**Why this matters**: The puzzle becomes solving Ax = b where:
- A is the button effect matrix (linear transformation)
- x is the button selection we want to find
- b is the target configuration (usually all-off)

**Key properties**:
1. **Dimension**: The vector space has dimension m×n
2. **Involution**: Every selection is its own inverse (sel + sel = 0)
3. **Commutativity**: Order of button presses doesn't matter
4. **Solvability**: A configuration is solvable iff it's in the image of the button matrix
