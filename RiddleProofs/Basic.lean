-- This file contains basic definitions and utilities shared across all riddle proofs
-- It serves as a foundation for the mathematical structures used in the puzzles

-- For now, this file is empty but could contain:
-- - Common data structures used across multiple puzzles
-- - Helper functions for combinatorial reasoning
-- - Shared probability theory setup
-- - Basic lemmas that apply to multiple riddles
