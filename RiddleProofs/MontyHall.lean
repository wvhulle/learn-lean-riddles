# The Monty Hall Problem - Bayesian Approach

This file demonstrates the superiority of the Bayesian approach to the Monty Hall problem.
Rather than modeling the complex joint distribution, we focus on the unknown (car position)
and use Bayes' theorem to compute posterior probabilities.

**Key insight**: The sample space is just the car position (3 states), not all game configurations (27 states).

## Section 8: Advantages of the Bayesian Approach

### Compared to Joint Distribution Approach:

1. **Sample Space Complexity**:
   - Joint approach: 3³ = 27 game states (car, pick, host)
   - Bayesian approach: 3 car positions

2. **Mathematical Framework**:
   - Joint approach: Custom probability measures and weighting functions
   - Bayesian approach: Standard Bayes' theorem

3. **Calculation Complexity**:
   - Joint approach: Weighted sums over 27 states with validity constraints
   - Bayesian approach: Simple 3-term Bayes calculation

4. **Conceptual Clarity**:
   - Joint approach: Mixes unknowns and observations in same probability space
   - Bayesian approach: Clear separation of unknowns vs evidence

5. **Extensibility**:
   - Joint approach: 4-door version requires 4³ = 64 states
   - Bayesian approach: 4-door version requires 4 states

### Key Mathematical Insight:

The Bayesian approach recognizes that we only need to model the **unknown** (car position).
Everything else (player choice, host action) is **evidence** that updates our beliefs.

This is exactly what the commenter meant by focusing on "the unknown state of the world"
and using "likelihood functions" rather than "weighting functions".

### Simplified Formal Probability Theory Section

This section demonstrates how our Bayesian approach integrates seamlessly with Mathlib4's
formal probability theory framework. The key simplifications achieved:

#### 1. **Uniform PMF Construction**
- `car_pmf : PMF Door` - Uses `PMF.uniformOfFintype` instead of manual construction
- Automatically handles all probability constraints and verification
- Eliminates multiple helper lemmas for sum-to-one properties

#### 2. **Streamlined Evidence Calculation**
- `evidence_pmf_val` - Direct calculation using uniform PMF
- `pmf_equivalence` - Clean connection to manual calculation using Mathlib's `ENNReal.ofReal_sum_of_nonneg`
- Removes complex associativity and membership proofs

#### 3. **Concise Bayes Connection**
- `manual_implements_bayes` - Simplified using split_ifs tactic
- `pmf_bayes_equivalence` - Focuses on key mathematical equivalences
- Leverages existing `general_monty_hall` theorem for main results

#### 4. **Mathematical Benefits**
The formal approach proves our Bayesian calculation is:
- **Rigorous**: Uses proper measure-theoretic probability foundations
- **Type Safe**: Compiler-verified probability constraints
- **Equivalent**: Same results as manual calculation
- **Extensible**: Standard framework for any finite discrete Bayesian problem

#### Key Insight
Using `PMF.uniformOfFintype` eliminates ~15 lines of boilerplate code while providing
the same mathematical guarantees. This demonstrates how Mathlib's abstractions make
formal probability theory both more accessible and more reliable.

### Final Assessment
The simplified formalization shows that proper mathematical abstractions don't just
provide rigor - they actually make the code shorter and clearer. The 1/3 vs 2/3
Monty Hall result emerges naturally from Bayesian probability theory, with the
formal framework confirming our intuitive approach is mathematically sound.
