# The Monty Hall Problem - Bayesian Approach

This file demonstrates the superiority of the Bayesian approach to the Monty Hall problem.
Rather than modeling the complex joint distribution, we focus on the unknown (car position)
and use Bayes' theorem to compute posterior probabilities.

**Key insight**: The sample space is just the car position (3 states), not all game configurations (27 states).

## Section 7: Advantages of the Bayesian Approach

### Compared to Joint Distribution Approach:

1. **Sample Space Complexity**:
   - Joint approach: 3³ = 27 game states (car, pick, host)
   - Bayesian approach: 3 car positions

2. **Mathematical Framework**:
   - Joint approach: Custom probability measures and weighting functions
   - Bayesian approach: Standard Bayes' theorem

3. **Calculation Complexity**:
   - Joint approach: Weighted sums over 27 states with validity constraints
   - Bayesian approach: Simple 3-term Bayes calculation

4. **Conceptual Clarity**:
   - Joint approach: Mixes unknowns and observations in same probability space
   - Bayesian approach: Clear separation of unknowns vs evidence

5. **Extensibility**:
   - Joint approach: 4-door version requires 4³ = 64 states
   - Bayesian approach: 4-door version requires 4 states

### Key Mathematical Insight:

The Bayesian approach recognizes that we only need to model the **unknown** (car position).
Everything else (player choice, host action) is **evidence** that updates our beliefs.

This is exactly what the commenter meant by focusing on "the unknown state of the world"
and using "likelihood functions" rather than "weighting functions".

### Connection to Mathlib4's Probability Theory

This section demonstrates a formal connection between our Bayesian calculation and
Mathlib4's probability theory framework. We have successfully implemented:

#### 1. **Formal PMF (Probability Mass Function)**
- `car_pmf : PMF Door` - A proper PMF using Mathlib4's `PMF` type
- Automatically ensures probabilities are ≥ 0 and sum to 1
- Provides type-safe probability operations

#### 2. **Likelihood Functions in ENNReal**
- `likelihood_ennreal` - Converts our real-valued likelihoods to Extended Non-Negative Reals
- Compatible with PMF operations and measure theory
- Preserves non-negativity automatically

#### 3. **Evidence Calculation using PMF**
- `evidence_pmf_val` - Computes evidence using proper PMF expectation
- Mathematically equivalent to our manual calculation via `pmf_equivalence` theorem
- Shows both approaches compute: ∑ door, P(car=door) * P(evidence|car=door)

#### 4. **Key Theoretical Results**
- `pmf_structure_correct` - Shows PMF values match our manual prior probabilities
- `pmf_equivalence` - Proves PMF evidence calculation equals manual calculation
- `manual_implements_bayes` - Confirms our approach implements standard Bayes' theorem
- `pmf_bayes_equivalence` - Connects PMF framework to our main Monty Hall results

#### 5. **Mathematical Validation**
The formal approach validates that our "simple" Bayesian calculation is actually:
- **Mathematically Rigorous**: Implements proper measure-theoretic probability
- **Type Safe**: Probabilities guaranteed to be well-formed
- **Computationally Equivalent**: Same numerical results as full formal approach
- **Extensible**: Framework handles any finite discrete Bayesian problem

#### Key Insight
This formalization proves that our intuitive Bayesian approach is not just
computationally simpler, but mathematically equivalent to the full formal
probability theory framework. The 1/3 vs 2/3 result emerges naturally from
the structure of conditional probability, regardless of implementation approach.

### Benefits of This Hybrid Approach

1. **Conceptual Clarity**: Simple functions for intuition and teaching
2. **Mathematical Rigor**: Formal PMF types for verification and theory
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Direct calculation for practical use
4. **Type Safety**: Compiler-checked probability constraints
5. **Extensibility**: Easy to modify for variants (4 doors, multiple hosts, etc.)

The formalization demonstrates that the Bayesian approach provides both
computational simplicity AND mathematical rigor - the best of both worlds.
