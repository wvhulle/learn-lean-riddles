# Problem statement: The jealous husbands puzzle

```
Left Bank                    River                    Right Bank
-----------------------------------------------------------------
H₁ W₁ H₂ W₂ H₃ W₃    [=======🚤======]               (empty)
```

Three husbands (H₁, H₂, H₃) and their wives (W₁, W₂, W₃) must cross a river using a small boat.

## The rules (constraints)

1. **Boat capacity**: The boat can carry at most 2 people at a time
2. **Boat operation**: The boat cannot cross the river by itself (someone must operate it)
3. **Jealousy constraint**: A wife cannot be alone with another husband unless her own husband is present

The **jealousy constraint** is the key challenge. For example:
- ❌ W₁ and H₂ cannot be together without H₁ present
- ✅ W₁, H₁, and H₂ can be together (H₁ protects his wife)
- ✅ H₁ and H₂ can be alone together (no wives involved)


## Challenges

- Can you generalize to N couples?
- What about more than 2 people in a boat?
- Can you optimize my BFS in `Search.lean`?
- Like `JealousMathematician.lean`, can you write a version for "cannibals and missionaries"?
