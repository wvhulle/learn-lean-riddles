/-! ## Abbreviated person input

Three display methods for Person type:
1. ToString instance: Use for string concatenation and debugging
2. Notation shortcuts: Use for quick input (H 0, W 1)
3. Unexpanders: Use for pretty-printing in goal view and error messages
-/
notation "H" n:max => Person.husband ⟨n, by decide⟩
notation "W" n:max => Person.wife ⟨n, by decide⟩

example : Person := H 0
example : Person := W 1

/- ## Abbreviated peron output
-/

instance : ToString Person where
  toString p := match p with
  | .husband i => s!"H{i.val}"
  | .wife i => s!"W{i.val}"



-- Test that notation and direct construction are equivalent
example : H 0 = Person.husband ⟨0, by decide⟩ := by rfl
example : W 2 = Person.wife ⟨2, by decide⟩ := by rfl

def unexpandHusband : Lean.PrettyPrinter.Unexpander
  | `($_ ⟨$n, $_⟩) => `(H $n)
  | `($_ $n) => `(W $n)

def unexpandWife : Lean.PrettyPrinter.Unexpander

-- Test that unexpanders work in equality proofs
example : Person.husband 0 = Person.husband ⟨0, by decide⟩ := by
  -- Put your cursor in front of `rfl`. You should see the unexpander being used

example : Person.wife ⟨1, by decide⟩ = Person.wife ⟨1, by decide⟩ := rfl



/-! ## Direction display methods

Two display methods for Direction type:
1. ToString instance: Use for compact string output (R/L)
2. Automatic Repr derivation: Use for debugging and #eval statements
-/

/-- Direction the boat travels. The boat must shuttle back and forth. -/
inductive Direction
| toRight  -- From left bank to right bank
| toLeft   -- From right bank to left bank
deriving DecidableEq, Repr

instance : ToString Direction where
  toString
  | .toRight => "R"
  | .toLeft => "L"

/-! ## Move structure and constructors

Core structure representing a single boat crossing move.
-/

structure Move where
  people_in_boat : Finset Person
  direction : Direction
  amount_people_in_boat : people_in_boat.card ≤ 2 ∧ people_in_boat.card > 0

def single (p : Person) (dir : Direction) : Move :=
  ⟨{p}, dir, by simp [Finset.card_singleton]⟩

def pair (p1 p2 : Person) (dir : Direction) (h : p1 ≠ p2) : Move :=
  ⟨{p1, p2}, dir, by
    constructor
    · simp [Finset.card_pair h]
    · simp [Finset.card_pair h]⟩

Examples:

- `R {H 0, W 0}`: Couple 0 moves right (together)
- `L {H 1, H 2}`: Husbands 1 and 2 move left (together) -/

instance: ToString Move where
  toString m := toString m.direction ++ "{" ++ formatPeople m.people_in_boat ++ "}"


-- Because `ToString` is implemented, you can see these evaluations:
#eval (R {Person.husband ⟨0, by decide⟩})     -- Should show "R{H0}"
#eval (L {Person.wife ⟨1, by decide⟩, Person.husband ⟨2, by decide⟩}) -- Should show "L{W1,H2}"
