This module provides the actual solution to the jealous mathematicians puzzle,
including the step-by-step transfers and verification that all intermediate
states are safe.

## Obtaining solution

In each step we will transfer a mathematician and a notebook across the river.

## Structural recursion

A kind of recursion that is easy to check for termination. Termination can be checked by Lean automatically because the argument visibly and syntactically "erodes" (or shrinks) in the recursive call.

In the following, the size of the argument changes `n + 1` -> `n` in the recursive call at the end of the recursive function body.

  | 0, _ => mathematicians_initial_state
  | n + 1, h =>
    let prev := intermediate_states_structural_rec n (Nat.lt_of_succ_lt h)
    (transfers.get ⟨n, Nat.lt_of_succ_lt h⟩) prev

def intermediate_states_structural : Fin n_states → MathematicianState := (fun n =>  intermediate_states_structural_rec n.val n.isLt)

## Well-founded recusion

Some types of recursion may lead to infinite loops. Well-founded recursion is a recursive closure with a proof that the recursive closure terminates.

The result of `measure` allows argument j := <n+1,_> to fix to be compared against the recursive argument i:= <n,_> by mapping these arguments to the natural numbers.

        (transfers.get ⟨n, Nat.lt_of_succ_lt h⟩) prev
