# The Monty Hall Problem

This file formalizes the Monty Hall problem, a classic probability puzzle.

**The Problem**

You are a contestant on a game show. You are presented with three closed doors. Behind one door is a car (the prize), and behind the other two are goats.

   ┌───────┐   ┌───────┐   ┌───────┐
   │ Door 1│   │ Door 2│   │ Door 3│
   │  ???  │   │  ???  │   │  ???  │
   └───────┘   └───────┘   └───────┘
      ^           ^           ^
   [Goat/Car]  [Goat/Car]  [Goat/Car]

You complete the following steps:
1. You choose one door.
2. The host, who knows where the car is, opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.
3. The host asks if you want to switch your choice to the remaining closed door.

**The Question**

Is it to your advantage to switch doors?
