# Birthday Problem

This file proves Theorem 93 from the [100 Theorems List](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/).

In a group of 23 people, what's the probability that at least two people
share the same birthday? (Assume 365 days in a year and ignore leap years.)

**Answer**: More than 50%! The crossover point is between 22 and 23 people.

## Key Mathematical Insights

1. **Combinatorial approach**: Model "everyone has different birthdays" as injective functions
   from people to days. Count using `Fintype.card (α ↪ β)`.

2. **Measure theory approach**: Use uniform probability on the space of all birthday assignments.
   The probability space is `Fin n → Fin m` with counting measure.

/-- Combinatorial version: comparing cardinalities of injective vs all functions -/
private theorem birthday :
    2 * ‖Fin 23 ↪ Fin 365‖ < ‖Fin 23 → Fin 365‖ ∧ 2 * ‖Fin 22 ↪ Fin 365‖ > ‖Fin 22 → Fin 365‖ := by

## Measure Theory Setup

To prove the probabilistic version, we need to equip our finite types with measure theory structure.
