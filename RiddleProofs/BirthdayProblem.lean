# Birthday Problem

This file proves Theorem 93 from the [100 Theorems List](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/).

**The problem**: In a group of 23 people, what's the probability that at least two people
share the same birthday? (Assume 365 days in a year and ignore leap years.)

**The surprising answer**: More than 50%! Specifically, about 50.7%.

**Mathematical approach**: Instead of calculating the probability directly, we calculate
the probability that everyone has different birthdays, then subtract from 1.

## Mathematical Intuition: Why This Result is Surprising

Most people's intuition severely **underestimates** the probability of birthday collisions. Here's why:

### The Intuitive (Wrong) Reasoning
- "There are 365 days and only 23 people"
- "23/365 ≈ 6.3%, so the chance should be small"
- **Problem**: This reasoning ignores that we're looking for **any pair** to match

### The Correct Reasoning: It's About Pairs!
- With 23 people, there are **C(23,2) = 253 possible pairs**
- Each pair has a 1/365 ≈ 0.27% chance of sharing a birthday
- We need **any one** of these 253 pairs to match
- **Key insight**: 253 independent events, each with small probability ⟹ high overall probability

### The Mathematical Reality
Let's build up the intuition step by step:

**2 people**: P(different) = 364/365 ≈ 99.7%
**3 people**: P(different) = (364/365) × (363/365) ≈ 99.2%
**10 people**: P(different) ≈ 88.3%
**20 people**: P(different) ≈ 58.9%
**23 people**: P(different) ≈ **49.3%** ⟹ P(same) ≈ **50.7%**

**The pattern**: Each new person has fewer "safe" days available, and the multiplication
of these decreasing fractions quickly drives the probability below 50%.

### Why Our Intuition Fails
1. **Linear vs. Quadratic Growth**: We think linearly about 23 people, but the number of pairs grows quadratically
2. **Birthday Paradox Effect**: We're not looking for a specific collision, but **any** collision
3. **Multiplication Compound Effect**: Even small decreases (364/365, 363/365, ...) multiply to create large effects

**Learning goals for this formalization**
- Understand the connection between counting and probability
- Learn about injective functions (embeddings) and their cardinality
- See how measure theory works in Lean for finite probability spaces
- Practice working with decidable computations

**Key insight**: We model "everyone has different birthdays" as an injective function
from people to days. The number of such functions is counted by `Fintype.card (α ↪ β)`.

As opposed to the standard probabilistic statement, we instead state the birthday problem
in terms of injective functions. The general result about `Fintype.card (α ↪ β)` which this proof
uses is `Fintype.card_embedding_eq`.

This theorem shows that:
- For 23 people: less than half of all birthday assignments have everyone with different birthdays
- For 22 people: more than half of all birthday assignments have everyone with different birthdays

The crossover point is between 22 and 23 people! -/

## Measure Theory Approach

This section proves the birthday problem using measure theory - the rigorous mathematical
foundation for probability. This is more advanced than the combinatorial approach above.

**Key concept**: We model the space of all birthday assignments as a measure space,
where each assignment has equal probability (uniform distribution).

-- **Setting up the probability space**
-- We need to tell Lean that our finite types can be equipped with probability measures

/- In order for Lean to understand that we can take probabilities in `Fin 23 → Fin 365`, we must
tell Lean that there is a `MeasurableSpace` structure on the space. Note that this instance
is only for `Fin m` - Lean automatically figures out that the function space `Fin n → Fin m`
is _also_ measurable, by using `MeasurableSpace.pi`, and furthermore that all sets are measurable,
from `MeasurableSingletonClass.pi`. -/
instance : MeasurableSpace (Fin m) :=
  ⊤  -- The discrete measurable space (all subsets are measurable)

instance : MeasurableSingletonClass (Fin m) :=
  ⟨fun _ => trivial⟩  -- Every singleton set is measurable

/- We then endow the space with a canonical measure, which is called ℙ.
We define this to be the uniform counting measure - each birthday assignment
is equally likely. -/

  ⟨uniformOn Set.univ⟩  -- Uniform distribution over all possible functions

-- The canonical measure on `Fin n → Fin m` is a probability measure (except on an empty space).
